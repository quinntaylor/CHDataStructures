/**
 An abstract class which implements many common behaviors of list-based collections.
 This class has a single instance variable on which all the implemented methods act,
 and also conforms to several protocols:
 
 - NSCoding
 - NSCopying
 - NSFastEnumeration
 
 This class also contains concrete implementations for the following methods:
 
 <pre><code>
 -(id) initWithArray:
 -(NSUInteger) count
 -(NSString*) description
 -(NSEnumerator*) objectEnumerator
 -(NSArray*) allObjects
 -(void) removeAllObjects
 -(void) removeObject:
 
 -(BOOL) containsObject:
 -(BOOL) containsObjectIdenticalTo:
 -(NSUInteger) indexOfObject:
 -(NSUInteger) indexOfObjectIdenticalTo:
 -(id) objectAtIndex:
 </code></pre>

 Rather than enforcing that this class be abstract, the contract is implied. In any
 case, instances of this class will be useless since there is no way to add objects.
